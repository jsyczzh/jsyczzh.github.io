I’m a first-year PhD student in School of Computing at the National University of Singapore, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Umang Mathur. I am broadly interested in program verification and logics.

Before coming to NUS, I worked with Prof. Joost-Pieter Katoen and Dr. Raphaël Berthon on stochastic games at RWTH Aachen, where I received my M.S. degree. I did my B.E. in Computer Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
