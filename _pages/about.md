I’m a first-year PhD student in School of Computing at the National University of Singapore, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Umang Mathur](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~umathur/). I am broadly interested in program verification and logics.

Before coming to NUS, I worked with [Prof. Joost-Pieter Katoen](https://moves.rwth-aachen.de/people/katoen/) and [Dr. Raphaël Berthon](https://moves.rwth-aachen.de/people/raphael-berthon/) on stochastic games at RWTH Aachen, where I received my M.S. degree. I did my B.E. in Computer Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
